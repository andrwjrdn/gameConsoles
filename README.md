Game Console Sales in Power BI

In this project, I took a small dataset of Gaming Console Sales to create a simple dashboard in Power BI. This dataset only used 1 table so I did not have to connect to any other tables to create model relationships.

<br> With the dataset I used, I was able to display the following:</br>
<ul>
  <li>Sales by Region in Bar Chart</li>
  <li>Profit by Product in Bar Chart</li>
  <li>Profit by Region in Donut Chart</li>
  <li>Sales and Profit in Funnel Chart</li>
  <li>Sales, Profit, and Average Price of console in Multi-Row Card</li>
  <li>Region in Slicer</li>
</ul>
